# Hall Images

This folder should contain the following PNG images:

- auditorium.png - Image for the Auditorium hall
- assembly.png - Image for the Assembly hall
- techpark.png - Image for the Tech park hall
- alumini.png - Image for the Alumini chamber
- libraryav.png - Image for the Library-AV hall

Since this is a static HTML/CSS/JS application, you'll need to add these images manually to the assets folder. The application will work without them, using the first letter of each hall name as a placeholder in the card design.

For now, the hall cards display the first letter of each hall name with a gradient background as a placeholder until you add the actual images.
